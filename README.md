# Graph traversal exercise 

Choose the code snippet with your preferred programming language. Analyze and improve the code sample in order to complete a graph challenge. Take a look at the below problem statement and compare it with the code sample. 

Problem statement:

We are building an autocomplete feature for retrieving words from a dictionary, where the first letters of each word match the entered text. Return complete words that begin with the entered text ordered by length, then by alphabetical order.

Guiding questions:

a. What kind of graph is used in the code? trie data structures

b. What graph traversal algorithms do you know?

c. Which graph traversal algorithm is used in the sample code? depth first search 

d. Does the code satisfy all aspects of the problem statement?
