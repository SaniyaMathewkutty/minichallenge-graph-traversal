# Graph traversal exercise 

Choose the code snippet with your preferred programming language. Analyze and improve the code sample in order to complete a graph challenge. Take a look at the below problem statement and compare it with the code sample. 

Problem statement:

We are building an autocomplete feature for retrieving words from a dictionary, where the first letters of each word match the entered text. Return complete words that begin with the entered text ordered by length, then by alphabetical order.

Guiding questions:
* What kind of graph is used in the code?
* What graph traversal algorithms do you know?
* Which graph traversal algorithm is used in the sample code?
* Does the code satisfy all aspects of the problem statement?
